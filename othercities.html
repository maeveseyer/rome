            Solo weekend trip to Naples! 
            I was very worried I was taking the wrong train so I asked four different people if I was in the right seat.
            Got there right before sunset, and got to my hostel which was called "Hopestel" and was all about zen and peace.
            They had a very pretty garden and it was a nice place! 
            Someone at the hostel made pasta for the group of us which had surprise tuna.

            Saturday was pretty much all Pompei. 
            Took an hour train to get there.
            Got a tip from two Massachusetts boys that I should download a guide beforehand, which was very helpful.
            Spent about 3 hours in Pompei which was perfect. 
            Here's me in a random ancient Roman temple.
